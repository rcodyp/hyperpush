# Project

## What This Is

Mesh is a programming language and backend application platform repository aimed at being trustworthy for real backend work, not just toy examples. The repo contains the compiler, runtime, formatter, LSP, REPL, package tooling, docs site, and two dogfood applications: `reference-backend/` as the narrow proof surface and `mesher/` as the broader pressure test.

## Core Value

Dogfood friction should turn into honest platform improvements: when Mesh or its data layer hits a real backend limitation, the repo should fix that limitation in Mesh and then use the repaired path in the app instead of carrying permanent folklore workarounds.

## Current State

Mesh already ships a broad backend-oriented stack:
- Rust workspace crates under `compiler/` for lexing, parsing, type checking, code generation, runtime, formatter, LSP, REPL, package tooling, and CLI commands
- native compilation to standalone binaries
- runtime support for actors, supervision, HTTP, WebSocket, JSON, database access, migrations, files, env, crypto, datetime, and collections
- dogfooded applications: `reference-backend/` and `mesher/`

Recent milestone state:
- M028 established the production-backend trust baseline around API + DB + migrations + jobs
- M029 completed the major formatter correctness and dogfood cleanup wave across `mesher/` and `reference-backend/`
- M031 fixed several real DX/compiler rough edges found through dogfooding and expanded the regression suite
- M032/S02 retired the unconstrained inferred-export blocker by threading concrete call-site signatures into MIR lowering, replaying `xmod_identity` as a success path, and dogfooding the repaired export via `mesher/storage/writer.mpl`
- M032/S03 retired the stale request/handler/control-flow folklore in the audited `mesher/` modules by dogfooding direct `Request.query(...)`, inline service-call `case`, and inline cast-handler `if/else`, while preserving the real route-closure, nested-`&&`, and timer keep-sites
- M032/S04 retired the stale module-boundary `from_json` folklore in Mesher's event ingestion/storage comments, kept the real PostgreSQL JSONB/ORM keep-sites explicit, and revalidated the supported cross-module `from_json` path plus Mesher fmt/build on the cleaned codebase
- M032/S05 replayed the full Mesher proof matrix, closed the supported-now versus retained-limit ledger, and left a short file-backed keep-list for the remaining Mesh and data-layer pressure sites
- M032/S06 backfilled the missing S01 acceptance artifact, reran the live S01 proof bundle with non-zero test-count guards, and closed the last milestone evidence gap so M032 now seals cleanly
- M032 is now fully closed through `.gsd/milestones/M032/M032-SUMMARY.md`, which records the compiler repair, the Mesher dogfood cleanup, and the three-bucket handoff into M033 (supported-now proof, still-real Mesh keep-sites, and real data-layer follow-on work)
- M033/S01 is now complete: Mesh ships the neutral expression builder and expression-aware Query/Repo select/update/upsert surface, Mesher’s S01-owned write paths run on that core, the live ingest/rate-limit/writer blockers are retired, and `bash scripts/verify-m033-s01.sh` closes green against the Postgres-backed acceptance suite
- M033/S02 is now complete: Mesh ships explicit PG helper usage on the live Mesher auth/search/JSONB/alert paths, the S02 proof bundle (`compiler/meshc/tests/e2e_m033_s02.rs`) passes against live Postgres, and `bash scripts/verify-m033-s02.sh` now enforces the owned keep-list plus the named S03 `extract_event_fields` raw boundary.

The next planned work is M033:
1. S03 should reuse the proven serializer/runtime contract plus the new explicit PG helper boundary to retire the harder read-side raw-query families without pretending every remaining query belongs in a universal neutral AST.
2. S04 should cover the retained partition/schema helper gap anchored by the `PARTITION BY` note while keeping SQLite-specific extras as a later vendor-specific seam instead of backing out a PG-only abstraction.
3. S05 should document the neutral-vs-PG boundary and replay the assembled Mesher data-layer acceptance suite end to end once S03/S04 land.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- Rust workspace under `compiler/` with separate crates for parser, type checker, codegen, runtime, formatter, LSP, CLI, REPL, and package tooling
- backend-first proof surfaces through `reference-backend/` and `mesher/`
- Mesh data access built around `Repo`, `Query`, and `Migration` runtime surfaces
- proof-first dogfooding: reproduce a real app limitation, fix Mesh at the source, then dogfood the repaired path back into the app
- keep the default surface boring and composable; use database-specific extras explicitly when the underlying behavior is genuinely vendor-specific

## Capability Contract

See `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the explicit capability contract, requirement status, and coverage mapping.
