# Requirements

This file is the explicit capability and coverage contract for the project.

## Active

### R007 — Mesh projects have a believable dependency/package workflow for building and shipping backend applications with reproducible inputs.
- Class: launchability
- Status: active
- Description: Mesh projects have a believable dependency/package workflow for building and shipping backend applications with reproducible inputs.
- Why it matters: A language may have good runtime features and still fail as a serious backend option if dependency flow is rough or confidence-eroding.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M030/S01 (provisional)
- Supporting slices: M030/S02 (provisional)
- Validation: mapped
- Notes: This sits after the backend trust baseline but is already part of the capability contract.

### R036 — The ORM and migration surfaces should keep a neutral baseline API while allowing explicit PG or SQLite extras when the underlying capability is not honestly portable.
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: The ORM and migration surfaces should keep a neutral baseline API while allowing explicit PG or SQLite extras when the underlying capability is not honestly portable.
- Why it matters: Fake portability preserves raw SQL and hides capability boundaries instead of making them explicit.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M033/S01 (provisional)
- Supporting slices: M033/S02, M033/S04 (provisional)
- Validation: mapped
- Notes: The immediate implementation pressure is PG-first because that is what `mesher/` actually uses now.

### R037 — Mesh should expose PG-specific query and migration surfaces for the cases `mesher/` actually needs today: JSONB-heavy data access, expression-heavy updates, full-text search, crypto helpers, and partition-related DDL.
- Class: integration
- Status: active
- Description: Mesh should expose PG-specific query and migration surfaces for the cases `mesher/` actually needs today: JSONB-heavy data access, expression-heavy updates, full-text search, crypto helpers, and partition-related DDL.
- Why it matters: Mesher's current escape hatches are concentrated in real PostgreSQL features, not generic SQL.
- Source: execution
- Primary owning slice: M033/S02 (provisional)
- Supporting slices: M033/S03, M033/S04 (provisional)
- Validation: mapped
- Notes: This is not a mandate to eliminate every escape hatch, only to cover the honest recurring pressure points.

### R038 — After M033, `mesher/` should use stronger Mesh ORM and migration surfaces for the cases they honestly cover, while retaining only a short justified keep-list of raw SQL and DDL escape hatches.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: After M033, `mesher/` should use stronger Mesh ORM and migration surfaces for the cases they honestly cover, while retaining only a short justified keep-list of raw SQL and DDL escape hatches.
- Why it matters: The goal is a better platform and cleaner dogfood, not a purity metric that damages the app or the API.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M033/S03 (provisional)
- Supporting slices: M033/S04, M033/S05 (provisional)
- Validation: mapped
- Notes: Behavior and data shape should stay stable unless a narrow change is unavoidable.

### R039 — Mesh migrations should cover the recurring schema and partition-management cases that force `mesher/` into raw DDL today, with explicit extras where needed.
- Class: launchability
- Status: active
- Description: Mesh migrations should cover the recurring schema and partition-management cases that force `mesher/` into raw DDL today, with explicit extras where needed.
- Why it matters: DDL gaps push real apps into hand-written SQL even when the patterns are common and stable.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M033/S04 (provisional)
- Supporting slices: M033/S02 (provisional)
- Validation: mapped
- Notes: Catalog inspection and truly dynamic DDL may still remain escape hatches if the dedicated surfaces would be dishonest or overly specific.

### R040 — The M033 data-layer design should be shaped so SQLite-specific extras can be added later without backing out a PG-only abstraction.
- Class: constraint
- Status: active
- Description: The M033 data-layer design should be shaped so SQLite-specific extras can be added later without backing out a PG-only abstraction.
- Why it matters: The user wants a neutral code path with explicit vendor extras, not a one-off Postgres trap.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M033/S01 (provisional)
- Supporting slices: M033/S02 (provisional)
- Validation: mapped
- Notes: SQLite extras are deferred implementation work, but the extension points should be designed now.

## Validated

### R001 — Mesh has an explicit definition of what "production ready language needs to have" means for this repo, and that baseline can be checked through concrete proof rather than vague claims.
- Class: launchability
- Status: validated
- Description: Mesh has an explicit definition of what "production ready language needs to have" means for this repo, and that baseline can be checked through concrete proof rather than vague claims.
- Why it matters: Without a baseline contract, the work turns into an endless feature list and nobody can tell whether Mesh actually became more trustworthy.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M028/S01
- Supporting slices: M028/S06
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated by the shipped `reference-backend/` package, canonical startup contract, and compiler e2e proof around API + DB + migrations + jobs.

### R002 — Mesh can power a real backend shape with an HTTP API, persistent database state, migrations, and background jobs in one coherent flow.
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: Mesh can power a real backend shape with an HTTP API, persistent database state, migrations, and background jobs in one coherent flow.

- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M028/S01
- Supporting slices: M028/S02, M028/S04, M028/S05, M028/S06
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated through live end-to-end verification of `reference-backend/`.

### R003 — The runtime path behind the canonical backend flow is exercised by automated verification strongly enough that the path is not just "implemented," but trusted.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: The runtime path behind the canonical backend flow is exercised by automated verification strongly enough that the path is not just "implemented," but trusted.
- Why it matters: A backend language loses credibility quickly if its basic runtime surfaces only work in isolated or manual scenarios.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M028/S02
- Supporting slices: M028/S06
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated by live Postgres-backed compiler e2e coverage on the reference backend.

### R004 — Mesh concurrency and supervision are proven under crash, restart, and failure-reporting scenarios instead of only being advertised as features.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Mesh concurrency and supervision are proven under crash, restart, and failure-reporting scenarios instead of only being advertised as features.
- Why it matters: "Concurrency exists but isn't trustworthy" was an explicit failure state.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M028/S05
- Supporting slices: M028/S02, M028/S06, M028/S07
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated by M028/S07 through the live recovery proof path, though the closeout rerun still recorded residual flake in one serial acceptance proof.

### R005 — Mesh's native-binary workflow is proven through a deployment path that feels closer to shipping a Go app than to assembling a fragile language stack.
- Class: launchability
- Status: validated
- Description: Mesh's native-binary workflow is proven through a deployment path that feels closer to shipping a Go app than to assembling a fragile language stack.
- Why it matters: Easier deployment is one of the first ways Mesh should beat Elixir for this repo's target use case.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M028/S04
- Supporting slices: M028/S06
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated by the boring native deployment proof for `reference-backend/`.

### R006 — Diagnostics, formatter, LSP, tests, and the coverage story are credible enough that a backend engineer can use Mesh daily without fighting the toolchain.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Diagnostics, formatter, LSP, tests, and the coverage story are credible enough that a backend engineer can use Mesh daily without fighting the toolchain.
- Why it matters: Better DX is part of the explicit comparison target against Elixir.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M028/S03
- Supporting slices: M030/S01 (provisional), M030/S02 (provisional)
- Validation: validated
- Notes: The toolchain is judged against real backend code, not toy fixtures.

### R008 — Mesh documentation and examples show a production-style backend path and do not rely mainly on toy examples to make the language look ready.
- Class: launchability
- Status: validated
- Description: Mesh documentation and examples show a production-style backend path and do not rely mainly on toy examples to make the language look ready.
- Why it matters: The docs must prove real use, not only advertise features.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M028/S06
- Supporting slices: M028/S01, M028/S03, M028/S04, M028/S05, M028/S07, M028/S08
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated through the reconciled production-proof surface.

### R009 — Mesh proves itself through a real reference backend that exercises the language as a backend platform instead of proving subsystems only in isolation.
- Class: differentiator
- Status: validated
- Description: Mesh proves itself through a real reference backend that exercises the language as a backend platform instead of proving subsystems only in isolation.
- Why it matters: Dogfooding is how the repo turns backend ambition into engineering pressure.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M028/S06
- Supporting slices: M028/S01, M028/S02, M028/S05, M028/S07
- Validation: validated
- Notes: The reference backend remains the narrow proof target; `mesher/` is the broader pressure test.

### R010 — The project can point to specific ways Mesh is easier to deploy, measurably fast, and nicer for backend development rather than vaguely claiming it is "better than Elixir."
- Class: differentiator
- Status: validated
- Description: The project can point to specific ways Mesh is easier to deploy, measurably fast, and nicer for backend development rather than vaguely claiming it is "better than Elixir."
- Why it matters: The comparison target is clear, but the comparison needs grounded evidence rather than rhetoric.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M032/S05
- Supporting slices: M028/S04, M028/S06
- Validation: Validated by the M028 native deploy proof plus the M032 closeout bundle: `bash scripts/verify-m032-s01.sh`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e m032_inferred -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e e2e_m032_supported_nested_wrapper_list_from_json -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e e2e_m032_supported_inline_writer_cast_body -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e_stdlib e2e_m032_route_closure_runtime_failure -- --nocapture`, `cargo run -q -p meshc -- fmt --check mesher`, and `cargo run -q -p meshc -- build mesher`, with the retained-limit ledger tying supported Mesher dogfood wins to honest remaining boundaries.
- Notes: M028 established the easier-deploy anchor through the boring native deployment proof; M032 closes the backend-development differentiator claim with current Mesher dogfood evidence instead of vague comparison language. M033 can deepen the data layer, but it no longer blocks this requirement.

### R011 — New language/runtime work after M028 should come from real backend friction discovered while using Mesh for actual backend code.
- Class: differentiator
- Status: validated
- Description: New language/runtime work after M028 should come from real backend friction discovered while using Mesh for actual backend code.
- Why it matters: This keeps the project from chasing clever language features that do not improve the target use case.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M032/S01
- Supporting slices: M032/S02, M032/S03, M032/S04, M032/S05
- Validation: Validated by the M032 slice chain plus the final S05 replay: `bash scripts/verify-m032-s01.sh`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e m032_inferred -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e e2e_m032_supported_nested_wrapper_list_from_json -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e e2e_m032_supported_inline_writer_cast_body -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e_stdlib e2e_m032_route_closure_runtime_failure -- --nocapture`, `cargo run -q -p meshc -- fmt --check mesher`, `cargo run -q -p meshc -- build mesher`, and the retained keep-site sweep over the real Mesher files.
- Notes: Validated by the full M032 dogfood wave: the language/runtime/tooling work came directly from Mesher pressure sites (inferred exports, request/handler cleanup, module-boundary JSON truth, and the final retained-limit ledger) instead of speculative language design.

### R013 — A blocking Mesh language/runtime/tooling limitation is not worked around indefinitely; it is fixed in Mesh and then used in mesher.
- Class: constraint
- Status: validated
- Description: A blocking Mesh language/runtime/tooling limitation is not worked around indefinitely; it is fixed in Mesh and then used in mesher.
- Why it matters: `mesher/` is a dogfooding vehicle as well as an application.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M032/S02
- Supporting slices: M032/S03, M032/S04, M032/S05
- Validation: Validated by `cargo test -q -p meshc --test e2e m032_inferred -- --nocapture`, the `xmod_identity` cross-module repro inside that test, `bash scripts/verify-m032-s01.sh`, `cargo run -q -p meshc -- fmt --check mesher`, and `cargo run -q -p meshc -- build mesher` after moving `flush_batch` into `mesher/storage/writer.mpl` and importing it from `mesher/services/writer.mpl`.
- Notes: M032/S02 fixed the unconstrained inferred-export lowering bug in Mesh, replayed the old `xmod_identity` repro as a success path, dogfooded the repaired module-boundary export from mesher, and S05 closed the milestone with the integrated replay plus retained-limit ledger so the fix stays visible as current proof.

### R015 — `else if` chains produce the correct branch value instead of returning garbage or crashing on certain types.
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: `else if` chains produce the correct branch value instead of returning garbage or crashing on certain types.
- Why it matters: Silent wrong-value bugs in basic control flow undermine all language trust.
- Source: execution
- Primary owning slice: M031/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Fixed by storing the resolved type in `infer_if`; backed by dedicated e2e coverage.

### R016 — Control-flow conditions ending in function calls parse correctly without workaround bindings.

### R018 — Parenthesized multiline imports parse into the same AST shape as flat imports.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Parenthesized multiline imports parse into the same AST shape as flat imports.
- Why it matters: Long import lines were unreadable and a recurring dogfood pain point.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M031/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Parser and e2e coverage prove single-line, multiline, and trailing-comma import groups.

### R019 — `fn_call(a, b, c,)` and multiline trailing-comma call formatting work correctly.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: `fn_call(a, b, c,)` and multiline trailing-comma call formatting work correctly.
- Why it matters: This is basic multiline ergonomics and diff hygiene.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M031/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Backed by parser, formatter, and dedicated e2e coverage.

- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: `reference-backend/` has zero `let _ =` side-effect bindings, no `== true` noise, struct update syntax, and idiomatic pipe usage.
- Why it matters: The reference backend is the primary proof surface and should model good Mesh code.

- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Proven by grep gates plus build, formatter, project tests, and e2e verification.

- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: `mesher/` has zero `let _ =` side-effect bindings, interpolation where appropriate, multiline imports, and idiomatic pipe usage.

- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M029/S02
- Supporting slices: M029/S01, M029/S03
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Validated by grep gates plus `meshc fmt --check mesher` and `meshc build mesher`.

### R025 — The suite covers bare expression statements, fn-call control-flow conditions, multiline calls/imports, trailing commas, service-handler struct updates, and related dogfood patterns.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: The suite covers bare expression statements, fn-call control-flow conditions, multiline calls/imports, trailing commas, service-handler struct updates, and related dogfood patterns.
- Why it matters: These patterns had little or no regression coverage before the M031 wave.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M031/S05
- Supporting slices: M031/S01, M031/S02
- Validation: validated

### R026 — Formatter output keeps `Api.Router` intact and does not collapse or corrupt multiline import groups.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Formatter output keeps `Api.Router` intact and does not collapse or corrupt multiline import groups.
- Why it matters: Formatter corruption destroys trust quickly and blocks dogfood cleanup.
- Source: execution
- Primary owning slice: M029/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Backed by formatter library tests, exact-output CLI tests, and clean `fmt --check` runs on both dogfood codebases.

### R027 — `reference-backend/` source files keep canonical dotted module paths and stay formatter-clean.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: `reference-backend/` source files keep canonical dotted module paths and stay formatter-clean.
- Why it matters: Formatter-induced import corruption in the primary backend proof surface undermines tooling trust.
- Source: execution
- Primary owning slice: M029/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: validated
- Notes: Proven by repaired source plus `fmt --check reference-backend` and dot-path grep gates.

### R035 — Comments in `mesher/` that claim a Mesh limitation or workaround must reflect current verified reality, not stale folklore.
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Comments in `mesher/` that claim a Mesh limitation or workaround must reflect current verified reality, not stale folklore.
- Why it matters: Stale limitation comments make Mesh look weaker than it is and hide the real regression surface.
- Source: execution
- Primary owning slice: M032/S01
- Supporting slices: M032/S03, M032/S04, M032/S05
- Validation: Validated by the named `e2e_m032_*` proofs, `bash scripts/verify-m032-s01.sh`, Mesher fmt/build, the negative grep over stale disproven limitation phrases, and the positive grep over the retained keep-sites in `mesher/ingestion/routes.mpl`, `mesher/services/stream_manager.mpl`, `mesher/services/writer.mpl`, `mesher/ingestion/pipeline.mpl`, `mesher/services/event_processor.mpl`, `mesher/ingestion/fingerprint.mpl`, `mesher/services/retention.mpl`, `mesher/api/team.mpl`, `mesher/storage/queries.mpl`, `mesher/storage/writer.mpl`, `mesher/migrations/20260216120000_create_initial_schema.mpl`, `mesher/types/event.mpl`, and `mesher/types/issue.mpl`.
- Notes: S01 classified the stale-vs-real workaround families, S03 and S04 retired the disproven request/handler/control-flow and module-boundary JSON folklore, and S05 closed the requirement with a short retained-limit ledger plus integrated proof replay.

## Deferred

### R014 — The creator-token treasury and fund product loop remains part of the broader repo backlog but is not part of the current Mesh platform milestone sequence.
- Class: constraint
- Status: deferred
- Description: The creator-token treasury and fund product loop remains part of the broader repo backlog but is not part of the current Mesh platform milestone sequence.

- Class: integration
- Status: deferred
- Description: SQLite-specific ORM and migration extras should be implemented after the neutral core and PG extras are proven on real pressure.
- Why it matters: The design should leave a clean SQLite path, but current implementation pressure is coming from Postgres-backed mesher work.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: M033 should shape the extension points so this later work is straightforward.

## Out of Scope

### R034 — M033 should not chase broad generic data-layer abstractions that do not retire a real pressure point from `mesher/`.
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: M033 should not chase broad generic data-layer abstractions that do not retire a real pressure point from `mesher/`.
- Why it matters: Over-generalizing the ORM would make the API worse while still missing the real dogfood gaps.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: The right bar is honest pressure coverage, not a giant clever DSL.

### R043 — The success bar is pragmatic reduction with a justified keep-list, not raw-SQL purity.
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: The success bar is pragmatic reduction with a justified keep-list, not raw-SQL purity.
- Why it matters: A fake zero target would incentivize dishonest abstractions and brittle rewrites.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Remaining escape hatches should be short, named, and justified.

### R044 — `mesher/` should remain behaviorally stable from the product point of view while the platform underneath it improves.
- Class: constraint
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: `mesher/` should remain behaviorally stable from the product point of view while the platform underneath it improves.
- Why it matters: This keeps the milestones focused on Mesh and data-layer capability rather than smuggling in a product redesign.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Narrow app changes are acceptable only when required to dogfood the repaired or expanded platform path.
