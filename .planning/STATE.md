# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Expressive, readable concurrency -- writing concurrent programs should feel as natural and clean as writing sequential code, with the safety net of supervision and fault tolerance built into the language.
**Current focus:** v13.0 Language Completeness — Phase 128-01 complete (TryFrom/TryInto trait registration), Phase 128-02 (E2E tests) next

## Current Position

Phase: 128 of 131 (TryFrom/TryInto Traits) — In Progress
Plan: 01 complete — Phase 128-02 next
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — 128-01 complete: TryFrom/TryInto trait registration + synthetic TryInto derivation

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 55% (6/11 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**All-time Totals (through v12.0):**
- Plans completed: 343

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 127 (Type Aliases) listed as independent of 126 — can run in parallel if desired
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 128 (TryFrom) depends on Phase 127 — type aliases may appear in TryFrom signatures
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 129 groups Map.collect fix (MAPCOL-01) with code quality (QUAL-01, QUAL-02) — small independent fixes bundled together
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 130 (Dogfooding) deferred until all compiler phases complete — prevents rework
- [v13.0 Roadmap]: Phase 131 (Docs) after dogfooding — examples sourced from verified Mesher patterns
- [Phase 126]: Made is_newline_insignificant pub(crate) rather than adding a new method — minimal change
- [Phase 126]: Named regression test e2e_pipe_126_regression (not e2e_pipe_regression_single_line) because e2e_pipe already exists
- [Phase 127-01]: ALIAS-04 validation skips generic aliases (type Pair<A,B>=...) since type vars aren't in registry
- [Phase 127-01]: target_type_name() returns None for complex types — only validates simple single-IDENT alias targets to avoid false positives
- [Phase 127]: Used single-file fallback form for E2E pub type alias test since compile_and_run writes one main.mpl file
- [Phase 127]: Made TypeRegistry::register_alias pub to allow pre-registration from infer_with_imports
- [Phase 127]: Added DOT to collect_annotation_tokens and IDENT.DOT.IDENT joining in parse_type_tokens to support qualified type annotations like Types.UserId
- [Phase 127]: Register imported aliases under qualified name (Types.UserId) as well as short name (UserId) during infer_with_imports pre-registration
- [Phase 127]: Use fn main() wrapper in cross-module fixtures — all compile_multifile_and_run tests require a main function
- [Phase 128-01]: No built-in TryFrom impls added — TryFrom is user-defined only (unlike From which ships Int->Float/String)
- [Phase 128-01]: TryInto return_type set to None in synthetic impl — actual Result<T,E> resolved per-impl from user body

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. v12.0 fully shipped. v13.0 roadmap created with 100% requirement coverage (17/17 mapped).
